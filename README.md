# Stock-Prediction-and-Alert-System-
This project is a Stock Prediction and Alert System that leverages historical data and technical indicators to generate short-term BUY/SELL signals using an XGBoost machine learning model. The app is built using Streamlit for interactive visualization and includes integration with Telegram, enabling users to receive alerts and data files instantly.

Key features:

Real-time analysis of Indian stock data (e.g., TATAGOLD.NS) using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

Calculation of technical indicators: Simple Moving Average (MA20), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands

Binary classification model (XGBoostClassifier) to predict the next-day movement (up/down)

Streamlit dashboard with visualizations, prediction results, and recent data snapshots

Live stock price tracking

One-click Telegram alerts to send prediction signals and CSV files directly to users

The system is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers interested in building end-to-end ML pipelines with live data, technical indicators, and real-time deployment.
